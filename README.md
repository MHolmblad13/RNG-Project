# RNG-Project

This repository will hold all of the RNG research I did with Dr. Peratt for my senior capstone project.

The Python code is using the Seaborn and Numpy libraries to plot histograms of the different versions of the chaotic tent map

The C code is the actual generator creating numbers and then outputting them to a text file. It use the GNU Scientific Library to produce the seed.

The .tex file, pictures of graphs, .sty files, .cls file, abbreviated output, and the pdf file are for the version of the RNG paper that I submitted to the 18th Annual Winona Computer Science Research Symposium where this project was awarded best research.
